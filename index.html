            <p class="cardInfoBody"> I am a confident person and I like myself​. There is only one of me. God never created another person just like me.
                I am unique​ and every uniqueness has its own greatness. ​I believe in myself, and I have faith in my ability.
                If ever in doubt, I ask myself, “Who says it can’t be done? Who is going to make that decision?” – The choice between a believing state of mind, or an unbelieving state of mind is always mine. I know I can only limit myself through my own limited thinking.
                Also, I fully realize that my confidence is released in action. If not backed by steady actions, it has no staying power. ​I am a very confident person; I always think Big, Act big, and Do Big!</p>
